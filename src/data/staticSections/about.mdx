Hi! I’m Natalie — my salsa and bachata journey started with lessons at Mambo and quickly grew into a passion that brought me to The Underdog. Over the past two years, I’ve had the amazing opportunity to teach at The Underdog while continuing to grow both as a dancer and instructor. With a background in Kinesiology & Physical Education, I love helping beginners discover the fun, confidence, and movement that dance can bring. Now, I’m excited to branch off and continue developing my own style, while sharing my love for Latin dance with new students. Whether you're brand new or looking to refine your skills, I can’t wait to dance with you!
