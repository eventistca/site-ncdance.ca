If you are unsure, you are welcome to observe classes (at no charge) prior to taking them. If it is your first time at the studio, we recommend taking a level that is lower for the following reasons; you may be unfamiliar with our teaching style, classes may be harder than what you are accustomed to and you might want to acclimate yourself to new surroundings. If you haven't danced in many years, you'll want to reintroduce your body and muscles slowly.

Remember, if you've chosen a class that is not best for you, we will happily switch you to another class.
