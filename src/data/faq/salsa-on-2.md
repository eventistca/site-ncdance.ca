question: 'What is dancing Salsa "On 2"?'
order: 100
draft: false

The music we dance to is written in 2 four beat measures (4/4 time) and we dance in a pattern of six steps danced over eight beats of the music. A "break step" is the step that you change the direction of your momentum. When your break step falls on the second and sixth beat of the music, then you are dancing "On 2". We use the wording "On 2" when describing the New York style of Salsa, and we teach that style exclusively.
