**Dancewear**

There is no dress code, so dress comfortably. Jeans or dressy pants and T-shirts for men. For ladies skirts, dresses or stretchy pants are perfect.

**Comfortable Shoes**

Shoes are important because your feet will feel the impact of the workout, and the last thing you need are pinching shoes. They should have a leather or suede bottom, which is how most proper ballroom & latin dancing shoes are constructed. Rubber soled shoes are not ideal for dancing due to too much traction. Ladies often wear high-heeled sandals from one-and-a-half to three inches. Ideally, women's shoes should have a soft sole and fit securely so that you won't have to worry about them falling off.

Be careful of the very high heels. If you can't walk properly in them, then you probably will have trouble dancing in them also. It is better to start out with a smaller heel and work your way up.
