Born and raised in Beijing, China, Lucy grew up learning different styles of traditional Chinese dancing since the age of 5. Her love for the art of music and dancing grew as she began performing with different teams and school around Beijing.

In 2002, Lucy moved to Canada with her family, and focused on schooling. It wasn't until after randomly stumbling into a salsa party in 2012, that she remembered her love for dance. Although she began dancing salsa on 1, after taking lessons with Mambo Production in the spring of 2013, she quickly fell in love with the Mambo style, and never looked back since then.

Lucy began dancing on the "Tumbao" and "Candela" performance team in the fall of 2013, she continued to improve her skills and in 2016 joined the Mambo Productions Advanced Performance Team. At the same time, she was training with Mambo Production's Director, David, on becoming an instructor, assisting and later on teaching different workshops, and in 2017, she became a co-director for the "Tumbao" team with David.

As an instructor, Lucy is known to push her dancers out of their comfort zone, and demands results from her team and students. Her favorite quote is "there is no short cut in life, the effort you put in determines the result you get out". She is a firm believer of work hard and play hard.
