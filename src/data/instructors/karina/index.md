Raised in Israel with a Russian background, Karina started training in Ballroom dancing at the age of 5 and was soon competing and performing nationally. At the age of 10 she exchanged dancing for professional martial arts training and came back to dance in 2016 when she took her first Salsa class with Mambo Productions.

Since her first class, Karina has become obsessed with Latin dancing and dedicated herself to learning the intricacies of Mambo, Bachata, Rumba and Afro-Cuban dancing. She has intensely trained with local and international instructors and has traveled the world dancing at various congresses and events.

Karina's favorite part of dancing is the unique connection created between people during social dancing, sharing the joy of music and movement while interacting through the universal language of dance.
