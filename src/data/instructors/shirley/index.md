I first stumbled into Latin dance just before the world shut down for covid, not knowing then how much it would change my life. But my story with dance started long before that. Growing up, I trained in Chinese dance and worked my way up to the highest-level certificate. It was intense, structured, and beautiful—and it taught me so much about discipline and expression.

When I moved to Canada, everything shifted. That's where I truly fell in love with Latin dance. Zouk was my entry point—something about its flow and connection just clicked with me. From there, I discovered Salsa and Bachata, and it felt like I was unlocking different parts of myself with each rhythm and step.

These days, I'm fully immersed in it all but especially focused on my Salsa journey. I've been training in Mambo with real dedication, working to deepen my technique and artistry in this style. Dance has become so much more than just movement for me—it's how I connect with people, express joy, and stay grounded. It's been a journey of blending the precision of my past with the passion and playfulness of Latin dance, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
