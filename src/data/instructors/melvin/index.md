Melvin developed his love for dancing at an early age. By the age of 8, he was already leading Igbo cultural dance troupes in his home country, Nigeria. He has since developed a soulful, and flavor-filled dancing style that embodies his unique understanding of musicality.

In an endeavor to broaden his dance styles, he started his salsa journey with Mambo Productions in 2014. He has since performed with different salsa dance teams, taught at several salsa workshops and private classes, and has become an integral part of the Calgary dance community.

He is appreciative of the instruction and encouragement he received from Mambo Productions, as well as other instructors and dancers in Calgary. He hopes to pay this forward by encouraging, teaching and helping salsa dancers to grow and reach new heights in their salsa journey.
