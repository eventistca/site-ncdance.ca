## Private Lesson Packages

Location: Private lessons are normally held at Ballroom & Country Dance Studio / 121, 17th Avenue NE (just off of Center Street North 5 minutes from downtown)

- Please call for private lesson pricing. We offer "pay as you go" pricing per lesson, and packages of 3 and 5 hours.

Do you prefer the undivided attention of your instructor? Are you already signed up for a class but would like some help with the material? Are you a busy professional and can't make the time commitment of scheduled classes?

Here are a few good reasons to choose Private Lessons:

- Private lessons are wonderful for people who prefer one-on-one instruction
- All of our privates are set up based around your schedule and for all levels and styles!
- Quicker progress is possible due to the one-on-one setting and the amount of information & feedback that can be given to the student

Please contact David at [403-710-5364](tel:403-710-5364) for more information or to book your private lesson.

## Student Referral Program

If you enjoy our classes and the unique Salsa & Latin Dance experience we provide then please tell your friends about us… and when you do you'll receive discounts on your classes. Here's how it works; refer a new student to Mambo Productions who signs up for a full session of classes and you get **10% off** your session of classes. In fact you can receive a **further 10% off** for each additional student you refer!

The not so "fine print":

- Discount amount is calculated as 10% of the course tuition paid (per person cost, if a couples rate was paid)
- Discounts may be accumulated up to, but not exceeding, a zero dollar amount for the cost of an individual course
- A "new" student is defined as one that has not been enrolled in a Mambo Productions group session for a period of three years or more
- The "new" student must tell us who he/she was referred by at the time of registration or at the start of the first class
