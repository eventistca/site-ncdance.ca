## Payment

Payment must be made in full on your first day of classes. We accept Cash, VISA, Mastercard, Union Pay, & Interac Direct Debit.

## Withdrawal Policy

A full refund is given only if a class is cancelled by Mambo Productions.
No refunds or credits will be provided after the first week of the session, unless the withdrawal is due to medical circumstances.
If the withdrawal is due to medical circumstances, a refund or credit will be awarded once a doctor’s note is received.
There are no refunds or credit for non-attendance and missed classes. If either the instructor or Mambo Productions cancels a class for any reason, a make up class will be offered.
Class transfers within the same session are allowed, space permitting.
All cancellations are subject to a 10% administrative fee.
Any refund issued without a valid medical reason, once the course has started, is subject to a $20.00 administration fee. Refunds are calculated on a pro-rated basis (ex: Refund Amount = [price of course / total weeks] x weeks remaining – admin fee).

## Private Lesson Packages

All multiple lesson Private Lesson Packages must be paid in full at the time of the first private lesson scheduled
Once the private lesson package is purchased, the lessons must be scheduled and completed within 6 months of the purchase date. Any remaining hours of private instruction not used within the said 6 months become null & void.

Should the 6 month time period be interrupted by illness or injury to either the student or instructor; then the lesson package may be extended if valid documentation of the illness or injury can be provided by a medical practitioner. Except for the medical reasons stated, there are no refunds provided for unused private lessons; and no refunds provided for any reason, other than medical, once a private lesson package has started (use of the first lesson).

\* Any refund issued for private lesson packages is also subject to the “Withdrawal Policy” above.
