**Common Questions we get asked:**

**Q: I have never danced Salsa or Bachata before, can I join a Beginner Salsa performance team?**  
A: A Beginner level performance team implies that you are a beginner in terms of stage performance, not in terms of dancing. Some previous experience in Latin dance and/or classes is required in order to learn Choreography concepts. We suggest you begin with a few Latin dance courses and supplement it with social dancing. Then you will posses the necessary tools to begin the performance journey.

**Q: I have taken a few Salsa and Bachata classes, but I'm fairly new to this. Am I good enough to be on a team?**  
A: Yes, being on team and getting on stage is a journey. You will not be on stage until 5 or 6 months into being on the team. It is our job to slowly prepare you step by step to do a stage performance. This is something you will gradually work up to.

**Q: Do I have to commit many hours per week to being on the team?**  
A: No, most of the teams meet for practice once per week for 1 – 1.5 hours. Closer to the first big shows of the season there is usually a few extra practices.

**Q: Will training choreography make me a better dancer?**  
A: Yes, training choreography will improve your technique. Any improvement in technique translates into more body control and awareness which makes you better on the social dance floor also.
